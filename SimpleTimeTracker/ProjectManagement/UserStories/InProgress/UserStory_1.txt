Simple Time Tracker - User Story 1
==================================

User Story: 
----------
(as a user) I want the logs of what I've done to be written down to a text file every day
So that I know what I've been working on and for how long 


Acceptance Criteria: 
--------------------

AC0: 

Log directory should be created if it doesn't exist.

Given:	'log' directory doesn't exist
When:	The tracker is opened
Then: 	The 'log' directory should be created


AC1: 

Log file for a day shouldn't initially exist.

Given	I haven't used the tracker today
When  	I check the 'logs' directory 
Then  	The file '$(currentDate).txt' should not exist 


AC2: 

The log file for a day should be created instantly with value '0 min'. 

Given	I run the tracker with a new task and no start time
Then 	The file '$(currentDate).txt' should be created 
and:    It should contain a single entry '$(currentTask) - 0 min'


AC3: 

The log file should be updated each minute. 

Given 	The tracker is running 
When	A subsequent minute passes
Then	The log file '$(currentDate).txt' should be updated: the last line should change from '$(currentTask) - $x min' to '$(currentTask) - $x+1 min' 


AC4: 

If the task was started with a non-zero time, the log should start with that time.

Given	I run the tracker with a new task and a non-zero start time of $x minutes 	
Then	The file '$(currentDate).txt' should be created
and:   	It should contain a single entry '$(currentTask) - $x min' 


AC5: 

When the timer is closed, current time should be saved. 

Given: 	The tracker is running
When: 	The tracker is closed
Then: 	The line '$(currentTask) - $x min $y sec' should be appended to the log file 


AC6: 

When the task changes to a different one, a new line should be append to the log file (with value '0 min'). 

Given: 	The tracker is running with a task A
When: 	The tracker is closed and reopened with a task B
Then: 	The line '$(currentTask) - 0 min' should be appended to the file


AC7: 

When the tracker is closed and reopened with the same task - a new line should be appended to the log file (with value '0 min').

Given: 	The tracker is running with a task A
When:	The tracker is closed and reopened with a task A 
Then: 	The line '$(currentTask) - 0 min' should be appended to the file 


AC8:

Manual changes to the current day log file should be possible while the tracker is running. 

Given: 	The tracker is running. 
When:	Current day log file is opened, modified and saved
Then: 	New changes should be preserved. 


AC9: 

When the user manually made a change to the last saved task name in the log file while the tracker was running, it should append a new line at the end.

Given: 	The tracker is running
When:	User manually changed the last line task name in the current day's log file
And:	A subsequent minute has passed
Then: 	The line '$(currentTask) - $x min' should be appended to the log file
