What the heck is this? 
----------------------

I developed those two tools mostly because I did want to have something for simple time tracking + pomodoro timer, but didn't want to have a complex GUI interface. I just wanted something that takes minimal amount of screen space and is very easy to use. 

This goal has been accomplished, I use them on a (more-less) daily basis (especially the time tracking tool). 


Simple Time Tracker
===================

A very simple time tracker. Tracks time spend on a single activity. 


Pomodorro Timer CLI
===================

A very simple command line utility for 'Pomodorro technique' (google it up or watch the intro video: http://pomodorotechnique.com).
